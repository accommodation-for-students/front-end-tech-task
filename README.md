This is a short exercise to rebuild the property card component shown below:

![Example Image](/example.png "Example")

## To do ##

- Run the app with `npm start`
- Run the tests with `npm test`
- Feel free to remove the placeholder `Message` component
- Build the property card component

Extra challenges if you'd like to attempt them:

- Layout multiple cards in a 3 column grid
- Only render properties with the property type `house`

## Notes ##

- You can find mock data for some properties in `src/data/properties.js`
- You will find variables for all the colours you need in `src/App.scss` 
- For the map pin icon you can use the existing component in `src/components/MapPinIcon.js` 
- The font used `Apax` is already available and can be used with the following property in your selectors `font-family: 'Apax', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`

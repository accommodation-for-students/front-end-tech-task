# Junior Front-End Developer Tech Task

First off, **don't worry**! This is a really quick coding challenge just to see how you approach the task and how you work.

**Try to focus on doing your best work, rather than rushing to complete everything.** You'll get more points for accuracy and attention to detail over speed.

If you get stuck or need some help, we're here to give you a hand! Helping eachother out is a big part of working at AFS.

## What we'd like you to do

We'd like you to build a `PropertyCard` component used on the AFS website using the example image below:

![Example Image](/example.png "Example")

### Tasks

1. Replace the placeholder `Message` component with the `PropertyCard`
2. Build the `PropertyCard` component using the example image as a reference 

### Bonus challenges if have time

- Write a unit test to check the correct information is displayed on the card
- Use the data to render all the properties in a grid
- Only render properties with `propertyType: 'house'`

## Tips

- You can find mock data for some properties in `src/data/properties.js`
- You will find variables for all the colours you need in `src/styles/settings.scss`
- The `MapPin` icon is provided for you in `src/components/MapPin`
- The font used `Apax` is already available and can be used with the following property in your selectors `font-family: 'Apax', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;`

## Running the app

This task is built using `create-react-app` and everything is installed and ready for you to begin coding.

### `npm start`

Runs the app and opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

### `npm test`

Runs the suite of unit tests using Jest. All test results will be logged to the console.
